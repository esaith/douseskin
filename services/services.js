I have been a licensed esthetician since 2017 and have since dabbled in makeup, skincare, facials, lashesâ€¦ etc. I have had my own personal gains and loses in the industry and in 2019 I decided to branch out on my own, Douse Skin Essentials, LLC !! I have currently had my business for a little over six months. I have obtained wholesaler membership status with several companies, I offer retail, I offer an ever-growing amount of services, I continually take classes to better myself and still, one of the biggest struggles is gaining exposure. I now feel as though I have reached a sweet spot and feel satisfied with not only the way my studio appears but with the substantial amount of services, products (retail) and customer-oriented education I provide. With these aspects of my business starting to flourish, my exposureis crying for help. Therefore, I decided to start my own blog!',

I currently have involved myself in skincare, lashes, waxing, makeup and will continue to grow within each avenue as well as take on other paths! Being a multidimensional individual keeps you up on your toes trying to keep up with new trends, skills and education! Hopefully if you\'re in a similar situation my personal experiences and thoughts can enlighten your journey!'
