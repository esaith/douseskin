        <div class='title'>How I ended up blogging as an esthetician:</div>
        <div class='subtitle'>The beginning of a long journey</div>

        <div class='paragraph'>
            Hello, my name is Veronica, I go by Veronica Arielle! I have been a licensed esthetician since 2017 and have
            since dabbled in makeup, skincare, facials, lashes… etc. I have had my own personal gains and loses in the
            industry and in 2019 I decided to branch out on my own, Douse Skin Essentials, LLC !! I have currently had
            my
            business for a little over six months. I have obtained wholesaler membership status with several companies,
            I
            offer retail, I offer an ever-growing amount of services, I continually take classes to better myself and
            still,
            one of the biggest struggles is gaining exposure. I now feel as though I have reached a sweet spot and feel
            satisfied with not only the way my studio appears but with the substantial amount of services, products
            (retail)
            and customer-oriented education I provide. With these aspects of my business starting to flourish, my
            exposure
            is crying for help. Therefore, I decided to start my own blog!
        </div>
        <div class='paragraph'>
            My purpose in this blog is to share my experiences as an esthetician and making it in this industry. I
            currently
            have involved myself in skincare, lashes, waxing, makeup and will continue to grow within each avenue as
            well as
            take on other paths! Being a multidimensional individual keeps you up on your toes trying to keep up with
            new
            trends, skills and education! Hopefully if you’re in a similar situation my personal experiences and
            thoughts
            can enlighten your journey!
